  - Retrieves data via external **API**.
  - Input numeric **validation**
  - Keyup **debouncing** (for performance improvement) by 'keyUpTypingMiliseconds' parameter.
- Data table
  - Data can be **sorted** by each column (Ascending/Descending order)
  - Local **caching** by both 'maxCachedItems' and 'expirationSecondsForItem' parameters.
  - **Loading** behavior.

## Running the app

First, run `npm install` in the root folder (to install all it's dependencies).

Then, Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
Note: If this port is already taken, you can use `ng serve --port <port>` and configure another one instead.

## That's it

Enjoy.
